Hi everyone! 

We are pleased to have brought back our flagship event, HACK@AC for its 3rd iteration in 2024! 

HACK@AC is an inter-school event which saw more than 350 participants from 128 teams compete in a gruelling 12-hour cybersecurity capture-the-flag competition on 24 February. On 2 March, we hosted our first ever in-person finale for HACK@AC.

During the finale, participants tried out different activities such as code golfing (solving a programming challenge using the least number of characters), blind coding (literally blindfolded), large language model prompt engineering, and hangman (powered by machine learning).

There were also challenge walkthroughs by our members, explaining the steps to solve certain challenges featured in the online CTF competition. Every participant also received complimentary HACK@AC merchandise, courtesy of ACS(I)'s Young Innovators' Society.

The finale ended off with prizes presented by our Deputy Principal, Mr Terence Chiew, with special prizes also presented for selected challenges. **Congratulations to the winners from NUS High School of Math and Science, Hillgrove Secondary School, and Singapore Polytechnic for emerging as winners in the Secondary and Tertiary categories!**

We are happy to say that this year's event was well received, with a very large turnout for both the finale and the CTF. We are glad for the enthusiasm shown and we will see you in the next iteration of HACK@AC!

Thank you!
