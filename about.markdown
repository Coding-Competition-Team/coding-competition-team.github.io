We are ACS(I)'s Coding Competition Team, and specialise in everything involving code. We pride ourselves in our eagerness to learn, explore, and apply our knowledge in various fields. Some of the things we do include competitive programming, cybersecurity capture-the-flag, app and web development, drone programming, and artificial intelligence amonst others.

# Why Us
At CCT, we believe that actions speak louder than words. Our achievements in national and international competitions stand as a testament to our dedication, skill, and relentless pursuit of excellence. 

From securing podium finishes at prestigious cybersecurity CTF events to excelling in competitive programming tournaments, our team consistently delivers results. We have earned top placements in highly competitive arenas, demonstrating our technical prowess and strategic thinking.

What sets us apart is our culture of continous learning and innovation. We embrace challenges in diverse fields, and our members collaborate, learn, and push boundaries together. For example, we can experiment with novel frameworks and technologies because we do not need to meet the demands of a production-ready software corporation.

Joining CCT means gaining access to hands-on experiences, expert mentorship, and a supportive community. Our members develop not only technical skills but also critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilitiesâ€”key qualities for future tech leaders.

Join us on our journey to innovate, compete, and lead in the ever-evolving world of technology.

# History of the Coding Competition Team
Before 2018, the school's Computer Services Team (known as CompServ) was beginning to fade away as a Co-Curricular Activity. There was a lack of leadership and direction for the club, and many members reported to CCA solely to fulfill their CCA criteria.

In 2018, the school decided to merge CompServ with the Robotics Club, known as 8059blank. The CCT began to find its footing and trained mainly for competitive programming competitions like the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI).

From around 2020, the club's leadership decided to explore the growing field of cybersecurity and began taking part in cybersecurity capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions. In 2023, the club also joined the field of drone programming and is looking to explore even more competitions.

In 2024, CCT expanded to a point where it needed greater autonomy from its parent Robotics Technology Society, and it was decided that from 2025 onwards, CCT would officially become a new CCA. This would also help the team gain greater recognition within the school.

Today, the club is filled with members who possess highly adaptable programming and problem-solving skills.
